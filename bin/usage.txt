Usage: staticr [options] <target dir> <route files ...>

  Options:

      --route, -r <route> Route(s) to include in build. If left out, all the 
                          defined routes will be included.

     --require, -m <name> Require the given module

    --exclude, -e <route> Route(s) to exclude from the build. If left out, all the
                          defined routes will be included.

             --stdout, -s Pipe a route to stdout instead of writing to a target folder.
                          This option only works for single routes specified with the --route parameter.
