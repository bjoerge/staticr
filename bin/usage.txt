Usage: staticr [options] <route file(s) ...>

  Options:

      --out-dir, -o <dir> Build all routes defined in route file(s) and output it to the specified
                          directory.

      --route, -r <route> Route(s) to include in build. If left out, all the
                          defined routes will be included.

             --stdout, -s Pipe a route to stdout instead of writing to output dir folder.
                          This option only works for single routes specified with the --route parameter.

     --require, -m <name> Require the given module

    --exclude, -e <route> Route(s) to exclude from the build. By default, all the
                          defined routes will be included.
